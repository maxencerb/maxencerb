### Hi there, I'm Maxence Raballand ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Fullstack and Blockchain Engineer with a passion for new technologies and a continuous desire to learn. My expertise spans Smart contracts, back-end and front-end development, and finance. I contribute to projects like Mangrove, Stake DAO, Blackpool, and Ownest Staking showcasing my diverse skills in the field.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently expanding my knowledge in DeFi, finance, and programming through self-teaching, after gaining a solid foundation in algorithms, mathematics, and physics at ESILV and a business perspective at Pace University.

ðŸŒ± Learning and building are at the core of my journey. Join me as I explore the future of technology and finance.
